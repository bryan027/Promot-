     <h3>My experience</h3>
           <p>My experience from Jr.SCLA is when i first started I was a shy kid i was scared to talk to the kids that were there and i would always in the corner and not talk. Threw the program they were able to help me to over come my fear or talking to people and help me practice my speaking skills so i wont be afriaid of talking to a large crowd. Threw the program i was able to make friends. learn how to make my own video game and understand the basics of how to create a website.  </p>

            <h3>JR.SCLA Program</h3>
            <p>Threw TXT you will learn how to code and learn to become young entrepreneurs. You get to learn how to build games and websites </p>
            <p>Through experiential learning, coaching & instruction, and mentorship, our Jr. TXTers use the skills gained throughout the summer to create a website that meets a social need or a demand in their community. The culmination of the Junior Summer Coding Leadership Academy is the Annual South Los Angeles Jr. Demo Day. On Jr. Demo Day, Jr. TXTers are enthused to showcase the skills that they have acquired, and the digital manifestations of those skills through the websites they have built which they will present to a panel of professionals.</p>
